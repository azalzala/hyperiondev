Answer here\n","* 3.1)  This is an inference problem of which values are abnormal compared to normal data values. Without prior knowledge of specific anomaly patterns, sensor data can be continuously fed into the algorithm without labels to determine important patterns. These patterns will automatically detect anomalies. Therefore, a unsupervised ML algorithm would be better.\n","* 3.2 A supervised algorithm that trains on existing examples of customer behavioural patterns is recommended versus a system that learns from itself, because the algorithm uses labelled data which will produce a rule that can calculate an estimate of customer lifetime value. \n","* 3.3 Segmenting customer demographics is a prediction problem that would do better with a supervised learning algorithm. This is because existing labelled explanatory variables such as purchase history, browsing behaviour and preferences can be used to decide on optimal decision rules. \n","* 3.4 To categorise social media posts into different themes, an unsupervised learning algorithm would do better because the lack of interpretability of features differing between millions of images can be differentiated continuously based on multiple parameters rather than a set of fixed labels.
